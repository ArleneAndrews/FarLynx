        <p>Welcome To FarLynx!</p>
        <p>Building on our combined experiences, we have made FarLynx into a leader in the areas of silicon cooking tools, baking forms, and customization of kitchen modules. These things capitalize on the strengths each of out founders have. Our passion
            is cooking, and producing the tools and spaces that make the process enjoyable, efficient, and delicious.</p>
        <p>
            Our products are researched, then tested in both institutions and nationally-recognized test kitchens to insure durability, ease of use, and address the specific ergonomic concerns of those who cook for a living. This ensures that any FarLynx product
            you purchase will have many hours of real-world testing behind it.</p>
        <p>
            Our kitchen modules are based on standard cabinet height, so we can use the basic construction plans to insure that the things fit. </p>
        <p>
            Tools are made from
            <a href="">silicon (link to information about silicon)</a> and are not going to melt, even when using some of them to turn food on a grill. The possibility of adding designs for the larger customers need to be mentioned, as well as the color
            ranges.
        </p>
        <p>
            Baking forms that we do are the high-end, one of a kind forms that will usually not be reused. For this reason, we use a thin-walled, treated form that will minimize sticking of both frozen and hot desserts. With the possibility of using silicon for
            smaller ones.</p>

                Mike Garand started a business that has grown into FarLynx making pan forms back in high school. He has gone on to create many custom forms, including a large multi-piece one used to replicate Bart Simpson for the anniversary dinner. His work in the past
                has been used as a basis for ice sculpting, the The San Francisco Ice Cream Festival, and custom small pies for the 150th birthday dinner at the Abe Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. His first pan was one invented to assist in making
                a chess cake.

                George G. Hamilton received his degree in Design in 1983, and has been working with many professional kitchens from then on. His work in designing our modular system of kitchen units has made a major difference in the availability of solutions in both
                the professional and home markets. Many of his works have been used in professional publications, and the designs are incorporated into the kitchen designs in motor homes
