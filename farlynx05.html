    <aside class="pquote">This is the expensive, and thoughtful part of the project. Every link must be checked, decisions on hosting and the purchase of a domain finalized, and not only a "Coming soon!" page created, but test pages to insure that everything works. </aside>

    Checklist for the page: Once it passes my internal check for quality, these things need to be done.
    <ul>
        <li>Custom page for errors</li>
        <li>Making sure all links lead to the correct pages</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the graphics work on all types of systems, from desktops to phones</li>
        <li>Verifiy information, and a last chance to add more</li>
        <li>Contacting a select list to verify use on different setups</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Domain hosting is the next item. This will have been discussed at the very beginning, and mentioned during every meeting. </p>
    <p>
        There are many domain extensions, and various methods to get the code up. Depending on the hosting chosen, there may be adjustment needed to insure the page looks best.</p>
    <p id="vanilla">
        With the choices out there, there are a range of prices for domains. I will work with you, and your service provider, to insure that the best deal: not only in terms of price, but of the amount of traffic the site can handle, and the amount of storage
        for pages, graphics, and emails.</p>
    <p>
        Custom email addresses are sometimes provided. These need tested, as well.</p>
    <p>
        Once all this is done, it's time for a first, different <span id="jumbo" color ="green">security test!</span>
        <p>This stage is going to be the most intensive one, and will take the longest. It will be run against the test site, insuring that all security features are as up-to-date as possible, and that there is no code that the host has entered that will
            expose your site to a potential problem. This first maintenance check is included in the cost of the site: we refuse to put a site out that will make problems for you, later.</p>
        <p>Depending on the results of this test, your site may not be available as quickly as you may expect. I will build extra time into the estimate, to insure that you have the site open on the day you wish.</p>
